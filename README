Orgtool
=======

`Orgtool` is an extremely flexible organizer platform. It encourages creation
of loosely coupled reusable components by combining `Docu`_'s fantastic
flexibility with `Tool`_'s signals-driven approach.

.. _Tool: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tool

Installation
------------

    $  pip install orgtool

This won't give you a working organizer. Orgtool is a *platform* so you need to
create a `Tool`_ project and include Orgtool's extensions as "bundles". Each
component provides commands, controllers, URL rules and templates (not
necessarily all of them). You can easily create almost any kind of organizer
(from PIM to a Trac clone) by combining existing components (`orgtool.ext.*`),
overriding their templates and writing your own components.
